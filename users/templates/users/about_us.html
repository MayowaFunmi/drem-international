        Destiny Rescue Mission Int'l (DREM) is a ministry committed to setting captives free. (ISAIAH 61:1-7, LUKE 4:18-19).<br>
        One faithful afternoon while on my way to campus ( Christ Apostolic Church Theological Seminary, Lagos State), God gave me the name while on motorbike.
        I received the calling to be on mission for Christ, to evangelise and groom youths & young adults alike, far back 6 to 7 years ago but was more glaring in the year 2015.<br>
        It all started with Facebook page and group, posting of articles by God's grace.
        Later, God gave directive to start weekly devotionals tagged: PERFECT LAW OF LIBERTY.
        We received divine instructions to start impacting, grooming & counselling youths via WhatsApp group, which started in 2018 and its tagged: DESTINY DISCOVERY AND COUNSELLING FORUM-DEDACOFOR. And since then, God has really been helping us to go out on outreach to motherless homes, Rehabilitation centres etc.<br>
        There are now 3 basic programs we are known with as a ministry according to the measure of grace received.
        <ol>
            <li>OUTREACH (to either hospital, rehabilitation centre, prison or motherless home every EASTER MONDAY of the year).</li>
            <li>BETHESDA EXPERIENCE (Every October 1st).</li>
            <li>OPERATION CARE for the POORS ON the STREET-OCPOS (Every boxing day, December 26th).</li>
        </ol>
